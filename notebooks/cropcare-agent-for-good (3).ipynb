Implement tillage (if feasible for soil conservation goals) to bury residue, and utilize a 2-3 year rotation with non-host crops (soybeans, small grains) to break the disease cycle.\",\n      \"Utilize Resistant Hybrids: For future plantings, select hybrids rated as having high resistance or tolerance to Gray Leaf Spot. This is the most effective long-term management strategy.\",\n      \"Fungicide Application Timing: Apply fungicides protectively or early curatively, ideally at the R1 (silking) stage.

Applications before tasseling (V18) are generally not cost-effective unless disease pressure is extremely high.\",\n      \"Fungicide Selection (Resistance Management): Use fungicides with multiple modes of action (MOA) to prevent resistance, as *Cercospora zeae-maydis* is highly prone to resistance development. Effective chemistries include: (a) Triazoles (DMI - FRAC Group 3, e.g., Tebuconazole, Propiconazole), (b) Strobilurins (QoI - FRAC Group 11, e.g., Azoxystrobin, Pyraclostrobin), and (c) Combination Products (pre-mixes containing Group 3 and Group 11, or newer combinations with SDHIs - FRAC Group 7).\",\n      \"Application Technique: Ensure thorough coverage of the entire plant canopy, especially the leaves in the middle and upper canopy. Use sufficient water carrier volume (typically 15-20 gallons per acre for ground application) and appropriate nozzles to penetrate dense corn foliage.\",\n      \"Follow-up Monitoring: If environmental conditions remain favorable for disease (extended moisture, warm temperatures) and a long grain-fill period is anticipated, a second application may be necessary 14\\u201321 days after the first application.
